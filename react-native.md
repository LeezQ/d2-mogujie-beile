# Native Vs Web 

<small style="font-size: 20px; ">http://goo.gl/JPG0zZ/</small>

* Why native is difficult {:&.moveIn}
    * it's harder to lay things out on the screen 
    * we often have to manually compute the size and position of all our views
    * need to recompile after every change, even if we just want to shift text a few pixels over on the screen.
    * need to wait weeks or months in order to get the results of an experiment or A/B test back

* web 
    * we can simply save our files and reload the browser to see the result of our changes. 
    * deliver a new version of the website twice a day {:&.moveIn}


    * “Move fast” is in Facebook's DNA, but we can't move as fast on mobile as we can on the web. So why make the switch away from web in the first place? {:&.moveIn}
